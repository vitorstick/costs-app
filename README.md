# CostsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). (only tested the calculation helper)

Used resolver to fetch data from cost.json and expense-rates.json that are on assets folder

Didn't pay too much attention to styles, except material icon package for icons
